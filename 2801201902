# We need to allow for the browser to load resources from a differnat origin, so we add this to our domain.tld.config file :
 add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' '*';
 add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Methods' 'GET, POST, OPTIONS';
 add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Headers' 'DNT,User-Agent,X-Requested-With,If-Modified-Since,Cache-Control,Content-Type,Range';
# We can also sepcify the exact origin, but we won't for now

#We must also tell wordpress where to load it's static content from by adding this to our wp-config file :
define( 'WP_CONTENT_URL', 'https://static.second_domain.tld' );

#Wordpress's staitc content is located in wp-content dir. All we need to do is copy it to static.second_domain.tld where another nginx server
# will serve the static content from and install LE for our static.second_domain.tld

#We can set the nginx server to only listen for https connections with :
 listen      443 default_server;
#in our nginx.conf file , http>>server block

# We can RateLimit the number of conurent requests from the same IP address to 100 , which is the same as limiting the concurrent
#resources requested from the same IP adress with the following :

limit_conn perip 100;
#One connection = one requsted resource

#This goes in our server block and is valid in both the main nginx.conf file, or in the static.second_domain.tld.conf file, but since we
#want to make global limitations it makes more sense to put it in our nginx.conf file.



# We need to sync changes to our static content to our static server. We can use wordpress for this, but we create a systemd service unit:
[Unit]
Description=Simple Daemon For syncing with static server.
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=root
WorkingDirectory=/home/stack
ExecStart=/home/stack/./send.sh
Restart=on-failure
# Other Restart options: or always, on-abort, etc

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target


#Were our send.sh script looks like this :
#!/bin/bash
#Simple check for changes made on the static content. If modification is detected - sync the resources.

#First we find all files that are static content:
STATIC=`find /var/www/html/public_html/domain.tld -type f -not -name '*php'` 
#Compare the MD5 sum value again and again with a while true loop:
while true
do tar -cf - ${STATIC} |md5sum | cut -d" " -f 1 > /home/sum1
SUM1=`cat /home/sum1`
sleep 30
tar -cf - ${STATIC} |md5sum | cut -d" " -f 1 > /home/sum2
SUM2=`cat /home/sum2`

#Compare the two vales and executes rsync if changes are detecter
function test()
{
if [ $SUM1 != $SUM2 ]
then
echo "Something has changed !"
rsync -avze 'ssh -i /home/stack/.ssh/private.key' ${STATIC}  user@hostname:/var/www/html/public_html/static.domain.tld 2> /var/log/sync.log
else echo "Nothing has changed"
fi
}
test
echo ${SUM1}
echo ${SUM2}

done
